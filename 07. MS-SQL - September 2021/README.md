# “JS Applications”

The [course](https://softuni.bg/trainings/3214/csharp-oop-february-2021) gives in-depth knowledge of JavaScript, such as:

In the "JS Applications" course you will learn what HTTP requests are and how to use them. You will learn about REST Services, what a Baas (backend as a service) is and how to work with it, what asynchronous code means (Promises, using async / await), what Templating and Routing are. During the course you will create a Single Page Application, using the learned techniques from previous lectures, where you will be evaluated. You will learn what the architecture of an application is and how to properly structure your applications. At the end of the course you will look at different design templates and their practical direction, you will create your own web components using the Web Components standard and you will build a Wepback environment from scratch.
